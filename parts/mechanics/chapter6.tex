\section{Discussion Questions}

% 6.1
\discussion{
    No. Work depends on the direction of the Force and Distance. Flipping the axie will flip the signs for both.
}

% 6.2
\discussion{
    There is no work being done. We are converting some "store" of energy into potential energy.
}

% 6.3
\discussion{
    Yes. We are simplifying this by ignoring energy in air, friction, etc.
}

% 6.4
\discussion{
    Since we are assuming we start with v_0=0 then w = \frac{mv^2}{2} after reaching a velocity (speed) of v.
    2w = \frac{m(v')^2}{2}, \sqrt{2}v, 2k
}

% 6.5
\discussion{
    Circular motion seems like a candidate.
}

% 6.6
\discussion{
    Should be the same magnitude byt positve for out-rope, and negative for rope-bucket.
