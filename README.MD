# Physics Problems

While (re)teaching myself physics I thought it might be helpful to do all the problems from the books I am reading.  Currently I am reading through [Sears and Zemansky's University Physics with Modern Physics, 14th Edition, Young and Freedman](https://www.amazon.com/University-Physics-Modern-14th/dp/0321973615).

## Schedule

I am going to be going pretty fast I hope, I already took a bunch of physics in my undergrad.  Here is a very roughed out schedule,

### 2018

I want to make it though what is normally Physics 1 and 2 by the end of the year.  

|        | September      | October        | November       | December       |
|-------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
|Book    | Physics1&2     | Physics1&2     | Physics1&2     | Physics1&2     |
|Chapers | Chapters 1-7   | Chapters 8-14  | Chapters 15-20 | Chapters 21-32 |

### 2019

I actually think I will be able to make it through the rest of the book in January.  Most of the material that is coverered in Quantum mechanics is mostly high level.  I will switch books in Febuary to [ntroduction to Electrodynamics 4th Edition, David J. Griffiths](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Electrodynamics-David-J-Griffiths/dp/1108420419).  There are only 12 chapters in this book but the content is much more difficult.
