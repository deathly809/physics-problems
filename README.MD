# Physics Problems

While (re)teaching myself physics I thought it might be helpful to do all the problems from the books I am reading.  Currently I am reading through [Sears and Zemansky's University Physics with Modern Physics, 14th Edition, Young and Freedman](https://www.amazon.com/University-Physics-Modern-14th/dp/0321973615).  Each chapter has the following problem sections

* Discussion Questions
* Exercises
* Problems
* Challange Problems


If things start to go slower than I want I will switch to only doing Discussion Questions and *Exercises*.  If I feel like I am missing things I will try to spread the work out amoing *Exercises* and *Problems*.

## Journal

I am going to keep track of how things are going.  This will be mostly for me so that I can stay encouraged and also gauge how I am doing.

You can follow along [here](docs/Journal.md) if you are realllly bored.

## Schedule

I am going to be going pretty fast I hope, I already took a bunch of physics in my undergrad.  Here is a very roughed out schedule,

### 2018

I want to make it though what is normally Physics 1 and 2 by the end of the year.  

|        | September      | October        | November       | December       |

|Status  | Halfway Ch 1   | TBD            | TBD            | TBD            |

### 2019

**Spring**

I actually think I will be able to make it through the rest of the book in January.  Most of the material that is coverered in Quantum mechanics is mostly high level.  I will switch books in Febuary to [Introduction to Electrodynamics 4ED, David J. Griffiths](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Electrodynamics-David-J-Griffiths/dp/1108420419).  There are only 12 chapters in this book but the content is much more difficult.

**Summer**

For the summer I will try to get into some more application type material.  Not sure on the chapters but I have two books of interest,  [Engineering Mechanics: Statics](https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Mechanics-William-F-Riley/dp/0471512419) and [Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics](https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Mechanics-Dynamics-William-Riley/dp/0471053392) by Wiley and Sturges. I might be forced to start reading back over my Calculus and  Differential Equations books and cover some other mathematical topics,

* [Essential Calculus: Early Transcendentals, James Stewart](https://www.amazon.com/Single-Variable-Essential-Calculus-Transcendentals/dp/B010WFJOGS)
* [Elementary Differential Equations, Kohler and Johnson](https://www.amazon.com/Elementary-Differential-Equations-Boundary-Problems/dp/0321398505)
* [Differential Equations with Boundary Value Problems, Selwyn Hollis](https://www.amazon.com/Differential-Equations-Boundary-Problems-2002-01-15/dp/B01A65FXLO/)
* [Mathematics for Physicists, Dennery and Krzywicki](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Physicists-Dover-Books-Physics/dp/0486691934)

|        | June           | July           |

|Chapers | TODO           | TODO           |
|Status  | TBD            | TBD            |
**Fall**

In the fall I will dig around for more advanced books.  I have some options such as 

* [Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, Griffiths and Schroeter](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Quantum-Mechanics-David-Griffiths/dp/1107189632)
* [Principles of Quantum Mechanics, Shankar](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Quantum-Mechanics-R-Shankar/dp/1475705786/)
* [Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, Griffiths and Schroeter](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Quantum-Mechanics-David-Griffiths/dp/1107189632)
