## July

Here I am again, making promises I cannot keep. When I look back I really hate myself since I could have finished everything for an undergraduate degree. I tend to just burn myself out and lose interest. Then when I come back I cannot remember stuff, or I feel like maybe I forgot stuff and have to go over it again.
