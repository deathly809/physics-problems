## 6/13/2020

I feel like a total failure.  I ended up just burning myself out and now I am going to try to start back up.

I noticed that the 2018 Journal and the main table do not match on the number of problems done.  This is because 
I did not convert from paper to \latex.  This is a low priority right now but I will probably start doing a few 
of these at a time.
