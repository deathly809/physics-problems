Slipping behind, also got sick and hurt my wrists/arm.  I finished chapter 5, but some of the problems are probably incorrect.  Need to make sure I go back over my problems and double check them.

I have started chapter 6 and I hope to finish it this week, it will probably take longer and I will probably start slipping even more, the problem is that I am low on free time.  I also still have to move over the problems to latex, I worry at this point I might never get that done, or even worse lose the notebook I have been recording them in.

Had surgery on my teeth and have been super slipping.  I plan on finishing chapter 7 today and thinking about moving over stuff to Latex but am afraid of slipping even more.  At least I finished chapter 6 and some of chapter 7, and chapter 7 has much fewer problems than 6.  I highly doubt I will finish chapters 8-14 this month, but next month I only have 5 chapters planned, if lucky I hope to catch back up.

Finished as much as I could.  Teeth are hurting so hard to concentrate.  Also had to cleanup some.  Tomorrow I will be done with chapter 7 as I only have 18 more problems remaining and I don't expect any of them to be a blocker.
