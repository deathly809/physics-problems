Slipping behind, also got sick and hurt my wrists/arm.  I finished chapter 5, but some of the problems are probably incorrect.  Need to make sure I go back over my problems and double check them.

I have started chapter 6 and I hope to finish it this week, it will probably take longer and I will probably start slipping even more, the problem is that I am low on free time.  I also still have to move over the problems to latex, I worry at this point I might never get that done, or even worse lose the notebook I have been recording them in.
