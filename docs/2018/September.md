Initialized the project.  Did the discussion questions and some of the exercises.

Finished the exercises.  So far they are straightforward but tedious.  I worry the concepts will not be the hard part but actually doing the work will be.  There are 40 exercises for chapter 1, I feel this might be too much if I want to meet my schedule.  I have already done 48 problems, which seem to look similar to the exercises.  

I have started finished over half the discussion problems for chapter 2, they are pretty straightforward and I hope tomorrow I can finish them along with most, if not all of the exercises for chapter 2.
