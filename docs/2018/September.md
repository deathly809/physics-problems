Initialized the project.  Did the discussion questions and some of the exercises.  

## 9/2/2018 

Finished the exercises.  So far they are straightforward but tedious.  I worry the concepts will not be the hard part but actually doing the work will be.  There are 40 exercises for chapter 1, I feel this might be too much if I want to meet my schedule.  I have already done 48 problems, which seem to look similar to the exercises.  

I have started finished over half the discussion problems for chapter 2, they are pretty straightforward and I hope tomorrow I can finish them along with most, if not all of the exercises for chapter 2.

## 9/2/2018

Finished up the discussion questions for chapter 2 and made up to exercise 29.  Problems are beoming more tedious, this makes me worry.  So far I have been working on the problems in my notebook and transferring them over to Latex when I can.  That is also taking up time as well.

Been mostly working in a notebook.  The part the actually takes the longest is converting everything to Latex and creating the graphs.  Tomorrow I plan on finishing chapter 4, and moving it over to Latex.  If possible I will try to get 2 chapters a week.  I had planned to get up to chapter 7 done and it looks like I might make it.  

Looking at the chart below I am about 40% of the way through the problems.  I can get them done quickly on paper but like I said above, putting them in Latex is taking the longest time.
