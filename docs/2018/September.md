## 9/1/2018

Initialized the project.  Did the discussion questions and some of the exercises.  

## 9/2/2018 

Finished the exercises.  So far they are straightforward but tedious.  I worry the concepts will not be the hard part but actually doing the work will be.  There are 40 exercises for chapter 1, I feel this might be too much if I want to meet my schedule.  I have already done 48 problems, which seem to look similar to the exercises.  

I have started finished over half the discussion problems for chapter 2, they are pretty straightforward and I hope tomorrow I can finish them along with most, if not all of the exercises for chapter 2.

## 9/2/2018

Finished up the discussion questions for chapter 2 and made up to exercise 29.  Problems are beoming more tedious, this makes me worry.  So far I have been working on the problems in my notebook and transferring them over to Latex when I can.  That is also taking up time as well.

## 9/15/2018

Been mostly working in a notebook.  The part the actually takes the longest is converting everything to Latex and creating the graphs.  Tomorrow I plan on finishing chapter 4, and moving it over to Latex.  If possible I will try to get 2 chapters a week.  I had planned to get up to chapter 7 done and it looks like I might make it.  

Looking at the chart below I am about 40% of the way through the problems.  I can get them done quickly on paper but like I said above, putting them in Latex is taking the longest time.

| Chapter    | Discussion | Exercises  | Problems   | Challenge  | Passage    | Total      |

## 9/16/2018

I inserted chapter 4's discussion questions.  I have started working on the exercises in my notebook and should update the latex maybe tonight, or if I can over the week.

## 9/23/2018

This entry I will have a status update and an idea.  Let's begin with the idea as it is more exciting than the status update.

### Idea

I was thinking about developing some software for tracking my progress, something more exciting than some markdown or basic journal format.  Something that can keep track of my progress, show predictions on how far I will make it, etc.  I think something like this would be helpful to multiple people but I am just not sure where to start.  I personally like desktop applications but I know a lot of people are moving to webapps.  If possible I would love to develop both and release them out to the public for people to use.

I will think about it more and maybe flesh out some more concrete ideas.

### Status 
Over the week I worked on some exercises when I could so that I am not just doing exercises all weekend, or rather not falling behind.  I have not put the exercises in Latex yet but I plan on doing it by the end of the month.  I feel that the conversion takes the longest which really discourges me. Over the week and during the weekend I knocked out chapter 4 and also over half of chapter 5.  I moved my progress into Excel so that it will be easier to keep track of what is done and what I have left.  For instance I have the percentage done, which shows that I am ~73% done with discussion questions and ~60% done with exercises.

Here are a sample of some of the tables I have an some information they tell me.


#### Percentage done

The percentage done really shows me how far I have progressed in terms of the discussion quetsions and exercises.  It also shows how much I am missing in the remaining questions that I am skipping.  Overall I am doing over 50% of the questions in each section which I think is pretty good.

| Chapter    | Discussion | Exercises  | Problems   | Challenges | Passage    | Total      |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
|1           | 100.0%     | 100.0%     | 0.0%       | 0.0%       | 0.0%       | 61.2%      |

|7           | 0.0%       | 0.0%       | 0.0%       | 0.0%       | 0.0%       | 0.0%       |
|Total       | 73.4%      | 59.7%      | 0.0%       | 0.0%       | 0.0%       | 40.2%      |

#### Remaining Problems

One of the things I was worried about was if I was going to make my goals of finishing the first 7 chapters of the book.  As you can see below I am halfway through chapter 5 exercises.  I feel that I will be able to finish the remainder of chapter 5 over this week and start into chapter 6.  Hopefully next weekened I will have knocked out chapter 6 and 7 and inserted everything into Latex.

#### Total number of Problems

As you can see chapters 5 and 6 have the most exercises which take up to most of my time.
