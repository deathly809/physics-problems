# 2018

## September

Initialized the project.  Planned on working through chapters 1-7.  So far it seems like that might not be possible.

## October

Finished a large majority of what I planned for in October, but it seems I might start slipping a chapter or 2 a month.  Problems are getting tedious and some of them are pretty difficult.  The problem is not the concepts but rather understanding the problems and what they are saying.  Without a picture things are a little ambigious.
